# Firework Simulator

A lot has changed since I originally posted this in 2017:

- Sound effects!
- New star distribution algorithm for more realistic bursts
- New shell types
- Proper fullscreen control
- Custom scaling control, allows larger shells to be viewed on small screens.
- _Many_ other enhancements and tweaks

**Extra fun:** Control slow motion  by dragging near the bottom of screen!

**Desktop keyboard shortcuts:**

- **P** - pause
- **O** - settings
